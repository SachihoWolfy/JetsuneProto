Prototype flight "Chaser" bullet hell.

Dodge bullets and chase down the enemy! Build up speed and hit Mach to gain on the enemy and put them down with a devestating blow!

- W/S Pitch
- A/D Yaw
- M1/M2 Thrust
- Left + Right (M1 + M2) to use Powerup
- Space to Change Camera


**Changelog v0.7.2:**

- Terrain has been repainted for environmental storytelling (It's getting hot, snow is melting) and to generally look better.
- New accumulating score and mini power-bar that only appears during point acquisition, meaning you don't have to take your eyes too far away from the action.
- Sachi now leans in the direction you are turning.
- Sachi has a separate animation from slowing down from Mach.
- Dialogue screens now look like dialogue screens.
    - Character portraits have been added to cutscenes. (Sachi's is temporary until I make art that is the same as Polaris's artstyle)
- Fixed a bug where the attack animation would be delayed
- Fixed a bug where using a powerup had a delayed animation
- Fixed a bug preventing player from interacting with settings in the pause menu.
- Fixed a bug where Linux users would experience glitchy shadows.
- Various minor improvements and Bug Fixes



Known Issues

- On some browsers, player acceleration is insanely sluggish. (Unsolved)
  - Might be a rendering thing slowing it down, but unsure if this is the true cause.
  - Windows with Chrome is recommended.
- First Time load is increasingly sluggish as the game gets more complex.
  - Might start considering individual platform builds.
